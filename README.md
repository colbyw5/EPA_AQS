###Data Visualizations of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS)  

Purpose: The purpose of this repository is to implement a variety of data visualizations using historical EPA air quality data. The EPA Data includes air quality measures such as PM2.5, Ozone, and Carbon Monoxide in major cities (Boston, NYC, etc.) from 1990-2019.

From the EPA's website: The Air Quality System (AQS) contains ambient air pollution data collected by EPA, state, local, and tribal air pollution control agencies from over thousands of monitors.  AQS also contains meteorological data, descriptive information about each monitoring station (including its geographic location and its operator), and data quality assurance/quality control information.  AQS data is used to:

- assess air quality
- assist in attainment/non-attainment designations
- evaluate State Implementation Plans for non-attainment areas
- perform modeling for permit review analysis
- prepare reports for Congress as mandated by the Clean Air Act
